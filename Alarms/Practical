etting Up A Billing Alarm on AWS
A billing alarm is a feature in AWS that notifies you when your spending crosses a predefined threshold. It provides real-time insights into your AWS costs, allowing you to take action before your budget spirals out of control.
Since billing is an administrative task, and we won’t be building anything in this tutorial, you don’t need to use your IAM Account, but you should. You should always build with your IAM User.


Step 01: Log in to the AWS Management Console.


Step 02: Navigate to Billing and Cost Management.


Step 03: Under Budgets and Planning: Select Budgets.


Step 04: Click Create budget.


Step 05: Budget setup: Use a template (simplified).


Step 06: Templates — new: Zero spend budget


Step 07: Budget name: My Zero-Spend Budget


Step 08: Email recipients: Your email address


Step 09: Click Create budget.


Step 10: Navigate to CloudWatch by typing CloudWatch in the Search bar.


Step 11: Click on Alarms.


Step 12: You should see the Alarm you just created right there.
