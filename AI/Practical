Let’s Build
Prompting Amazon Q

I know (hope) you’re eager to set something up. In this practical, hands-on-tutorial, we will demonstrate Generative AI with Amazon Q.

Prerequisites
An AWS Administrative Account

Prompting Amazon Q From Your Management Console
Amazon Q is integrated within your AWS Management Console, and all you need to do is log in.

Since we won’t be building anything in this tutorial, you don’t need to use your IAM Account, but you should. You should always build with your IAM User.

Step 01: Login in to the AWS Management Console


Step 02: Click on the Amazon Q button on the right side of the page.


Step 03: Type a question. For example, I typed: “How to build a conversational chatbot?”
Amazon Q then provided me with a step-by-step guide.

You can ask Amazon Q anything about AWS and use it as your companion as you begin and continue your journey with building on AWS.
