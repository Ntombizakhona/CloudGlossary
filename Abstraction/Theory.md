# Abstraction 
## Simplifying The Complex By Hiding Complicated Details

*Abstraction* sounds like a scary, complex word when you encounter it for the first time, but it is a universal concept that transcends boundaries across various industries.

From the precise realm of mathematics to the creative expanse of the arts. 
It’s a powerful tool that enables us to simplify complex realities, focus on essential features, and convey intricate ideas in a more digestible form. By omitting unnecessary details and emphasizing key elements, abstraction helps us comprehend, communicate, and innovate more effectively.


# Abstraction as a Concept Across Disciplines
Since abstraction is not exclusive to the cloud, these definitions and analogies demonstrate its far-reaching applicability across various fields, allowing us to develop a more sophisticated and nuanced comprehension of the concept.

## Abstraction in Computer Science
Abstraction is the process of exposing essential features while hiding implementation details, enabling modular programming and software development.
In Computer Science, Abstraction is like building a LEGO castle. You create a structure (program) using individual blocks (code) that hide the details of how they’re assembled, allowing you to focus on the overall design.

## Abstraction in Engineering
Abstraction is used to design and develop systems, focusing on functional requirements while hiding implementation details.
Abstraction is like designing a car. You focus on functional requirements (speed, safety) while hiding implementation details (engine, transmission).

## Abstraction in Mathematics
Abstraction involves generalizing specific instances into broader concepts, like grouping numbers into sets or defining algebraic structures.

Abstraction is like grouping different types of fruit (apples, bananas, oranges) into a single category (fruit). You focus on shared characteristics, ignoring specific details.

## Abstraction in Art
Abstraction refers to non-representational art that doesn’t depict realistic subjects, instead focusing on colors, shapes, and forms to convey emotions and ideas.

Abstraction is like creating a puzzle. You take individual pieces (colors, shapes) and combine them to form a larger image that conveys a message or emotion, rather than a literal representation.

## Abstraction in Philosophy
Abstraction is the mental process of isolating essential properties or characteristics from specific instances, leading to general concepts and theories.

Abstraction is like looking at a forest instead of individual trees. You step back to see the bigger picture.

## Abstraction in Science
Abstraction entails simplifying complex systems or phenomena into theoretical models or representations, facilitating understanding and analysis.
Abstraction is like creating a map. You simplify complex terrain (data) into a representative model (theory), highlighting key features and relationships.

## Abstraction in Music
Abstraction in music refers to experimental or avant-garde compositions that depart from traditional melodies and harmonies, emphasizing sound textures and atmospheres.

Abstraction is like creating a soundscape. You combine individual sounds (instruments, effects) to evoke an atmosphere or mood, rather than a specific melody.

## Abstraction in Literature
Abstraction in literature involves using symbolic language, metaphors, and allegories to convey complex ideas and themes beyond literal interpretations.
Abstraction is like writing a poem. You use words and metaphors to convey emotions and ideas, rather than literal descriptions.

## Abstraction in Economics
Abstraction in economics involves modeling complex systems, simplifying assumptions, and analyzing economic phenomena through theoretical frameworks.
Abstraction is like creating a financial model. You simplify complex systems (markets, economies) into theoretical frameworks to analyze and predict behavior.

## Abstraction in Cognitive Science
Abstraction is the cognitive process of categorizing, generalizing, and forming mental representations of the world.
Abstraction is like categorizing animals into species. You group individual instances (animals) based on shared characteristics, forming mental representations.

## Abstraction in Linguistics
Abstraction in linguistics involves analyzing language structures, identifying patterns, and developing theoretical models of language acquisition and use.
Abstraction is like learning a language. You identify patterns and structures (grammar, syntax) to understand and communicate effectively.

## Abstraction in Business
Abstraction in business refers to identifying essential factors, simplifying complex processes, and developing strategic models to drive decision-making.
Abstraction is like developing a marketing strategy. You identify essential factors (target audience, messaging) and simplify complex processes to drive decision-making.

## Abstraction in Psychology
Abstraction is the mental process of forming concepts, categorizing experiences, and developing mental representations of the world.
Abstraction is like forming memories. You categorize experiences and emotions, creating mental representations that influence future behaviors.

## Abstraction in Architecture
Abstraction in architecture involves designing buildings and spaces that prioritize functional and aesthetic essentials over ornamental details.
Abstraction is like designing a building facade. You prioritize functional and aesthetic essentials (structure, appearance) over ornamental details.

## Abstraction in Data Analysis
Abstraction in data analysis entails identifying key variables, simplifying complex data sets, and developing models to extract insights.
Abstraction is like creating a dashboard. You identify key variables (metrics, trends) and simplify complex data sets to extract insights and inform decisions.

*…You get the point. If you’re transitioning to the cloud from one of the aforementioned industries, you can leverage your existing knowledge to understand what abstraction in the cloud means.*


# Abstraction in the Cloud
The Cloud builds upon the principles of computer science, and abstraction is a key concept that makes it more accessible. Think of abstraction like a filter that simplifies complex details by hiding them away from you, letting you focus on what matters.

In programming, abstraction helps hide intricate code details, allowing developers to concentrate on the logic of their application. Similarly, cloud providers use abstraction to conceal the complexity of infrastructure, offering pre-built services and managed platforms that are easy to use.

This abstraction enables you to focus on your goals, like deploying and managing applications, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. It’s like having a trusted partner handle the complicated details, so you can concentrate on what you do best.



### Putting it All Together with An Analogy
# Automatic Vehicle

Abstraction in cloud computing is like the difference between driving a manual car versus driving an automatic vehicle, where a manual car is traditional on-premises infrastructure, and the automatic vehicle is the cloud.

## Manual Cars (On Premises)
*No Abstraction*
Driving a manual (stick-shift) car requires direct control over gears and the clutch: In manual cars, you have fine-grained control but must manage every detail (shifting gears, clutch coordination). Similarly, on-premise solutions involve managing infrastructure at a granular level (physical servers, networking, security).

## Automatic Cars (the Cloud)
*An Abstraction of Manual Cars*
Automatic cars handle gear changes automatically, simplifying driving:
Cloud services abstract away low-level infrastructure tasks. Just as automatic cars free you from gear management, cloud abstracts infrastructure complexities.

So would you rather be shifting gears the whole day, dealing with the clutch, waiting eons for the car to start in cold weather, and likely cause unnecessary accidents when ascending uphill on a rainy day? (On-Premises)

or

Do you want to just push a start button and go, where you just steer yourself in the right direction, accelerate when you need to and easily stop when you want? (Cloud Computing).

*This analogy emphasizes that the core complicated, technical components are not completely gone, they are simply hidden and managed by the cloud provider, simplifying your experience so you innovate and build faster.*


# Concluding Remarks
You will encounter the term abstraction frequently when reading documentation about cloud services, especially when it comes to newer, evolved releases. 

Your task is not necessarily to take action, but rather to understand and appreciate what the cloud provider has abstracted away to simplify certain services for your benefit.
