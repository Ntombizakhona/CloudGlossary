Cloud Computing Simplified: A Cloud Glossary for Beginners

Introduction

Welcome to this cloud glossary project, aimed at simplifying cloud computing terminology for beginners. As a cloud enthusiast, I've encountered many who are interested in cloud computing but are overwhelmed by the technical jargon. This project aims to explain cloud terms in a simple and easy-to-understand way, starting with "abstraction" and covering topics up to "zero trust".

Motivation

I was inspired to create this glossary after encountering someone who didn't know what AWS was, and realizing that many people are eager to learn about cloud computing but are held back by unfamiliar terminology.

Definition of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. (Source: NIST)

Simplified Explanation

Imagine having access to your favorite coffee shop's Wi-Fi from anywhere, at any time. Cloud computing is like a vending machine, where you can quickly get what you need (resources) without having to go through a long process.

Benefits of Getting Started with the Cloud

- Ease of entry: quickly sign up and start using cloud services without significant upfront costs or complex setup processes.
- Ease of exit: easily terminate your service or migrate to a different provider without being locked in or facing significant penalties.

What You Need to Get Started

- Yourself
- A laptop
- An internet connection
- Curiosity about technology
- A willingness to learn and adapt

Prioritized Cloud Provider

I will be prioritizing Amazon Web Services (AWS) as my preferred cloud provider for technical examples and relevant services.

Glossary

Coming soon! This glossary will cover cloud terms from "abstraction" to "zero trust", explained in a simple and easy-to-understand way.
