Amazon Web Services
===================

Cloud Computing Provider
------------------------


AWS starts with ‘A’ because it’s the ideal cloud provider or platform to begin your cloud learning journey or migration to the cloud. In fact, when it comes to anything cloud-related, start with ‘A’ — start with Amazon Web Services. I may sound like I’m advertising them, but fear not, it’s just an ethical, heart felt endorsement.

**The Origins of AWS**
----------------------

Every super hero has an origin story, and AWS is no different. Amazon Web Services, Inc was officially launched in 2006, by its parent company Amazon (.com).

The first service that was _officially_ launched by AWS is Simple Storage Service (S3), a simple storage service as the name implies, and then came compute power.

Did you know about it’s South African Origins in Cape Town? So, Cape Town is considered the birthplace of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (more affectionately known as EC2), the second service offered by AWS.

> This origin story traces back to the founding of the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ([Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)) service in 2004, which is now regarded as one of the fundamental pieces of cloud computing technology. A passionate team of AWS developers and engineers in Cape Town, South Africa, created a single virtual server instance allowing South African customers to access practically unlimited cloud computing capacity without needing an on-premises data center. It was a watershed moment for AWS, and it changed the trajectory of cloud computing worldwide.

…And then came databases, and then this, and then that…

Why Do Some Services Start With AWS and Others With Amazon?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Once you get started with AWS, you might notice the naming system, and ask, “Why do some services start with AWS and others with Amazon.”

Answer: …**because they can**, _next_.

> There are several theories around it and for every one of those theories you can find an exception.
> 
> The one aspect that stands out the most is that most services with an Amazon prefix can function independently, without requiring other services to operate (consider Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Amazon SQS, Amazon Quicksight, etc.).
> 
> From a user’s perspective, these services can be used as standalone solutions. On the other hand, AWS-prefixed services often rely on additional services to function at all, serving as “building blocks” that AWS frequently mentions.
> 
> For instance, AWS AppSync is a GraphQL API, but it requires integration with backend services or AWS Step Functions, which act as a control plane for other services. There are exceptions, such as AWS Lambda, which can now be used standalone (thanks to function URLs introduced in 2022), while others argue that Amazon API Gateway is largely useless without accompanying backend services. — **_Markus Ostertag_** _(AWS Community Hero)_

I know it’ll be tempting to try to identify a pattern to simplify your learning, but don’t spend too much time attempting to decipher a pattern, okay? Instead, focus on understanding the function and purpose of each service. It’s like wondering why the sky is called the sky and the sea is called the sea, rather than simply appreciating and enjoying your day at the beach with your delicious ice cream.

At this point AWS needs to release an _official_ statement so that we stop getting lost in the sauce of speculation.

### Putting it All Together with An Analogy

International Property Developer
--------------------------------

Imagine AWS as an **international property developer** in a futuristic version of Earth, where the _cloud_ is the land.

Like a global real estate giant, AWS acquires prime land across the world, with data centers and infrastructure in more than 25 regions. On this land, it builds fully equipped properties : cloud services such as EC2, S3, and many others, then manages and maintains them so tenants never have to worry about upkeep.

Customers can rent these properties on flexible, pay‑as‑you‑go lease terms, using only what they need, when they need it. High‑speed transportation routes connect all locations, representing AWS’s global network and edge infrastructure that enables fast, reliable data transfer.

Tenants can easily expand, scale, or even move their operations between properties, thanks to AWS’s globally consistent infrastructure. AWS continuously develops new buildings and services, making the portfolio larger and more advanced over time.

Best of all, the spaces are move‑in ready: anyone can sign up and start immediately while a thriving community of builders, forums, and meetups helps tenants learn, collaborate, and succeed.


Summary
-------

AWS is positioned as the ideal starting point for cloud adoption, launched in 2006 with S3 as its first service and EC2 developed in Cape Town, South Africa.

From these two foundational services, AWS has expanded to hundreds of offerings across computing, storage, databases, AI/ML, and emerging technologies, supported by the world’s largest cloud infrastructure with global regions and availability zones.

Major companies like Netflix, Uber, and Spotify rely on AWS for their core operations, while the platform offers extensive community support, learning resources, and career opportunities, making it the recommended entry point for anyone beginning their cloud journey.

### [The Story of AWS](https://medium.com/@furrier/original-content-the-story-of-aws-and-andy-jassys-trillion-dollar-baby-4e8a35fd7ed)

> Amazon Web Services wasn’t any one person’s single idea. No proverbial apple fell on some Newton’s head, no Henry Ford or Steve Jobs-like character had a brainstorm. Instead, it rather emerged. The idea grew organically out of the company’s frustration with its ability to launch new projects and support customers.

### [The Origins of AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/our-origins/)

> That’s why we launched Amazon Web Services in the spring of 2006, to rethink IT infrastructure completely, so that anyone — even a kid in a college dorm room — could access the same powerful technology as the world’s largest and most sophisticated companies.

### [The South African Origins of AWS](https://qz.com/africa/1969651/the-south-african-origins-of-andy-jassys-amazon-web-services)
