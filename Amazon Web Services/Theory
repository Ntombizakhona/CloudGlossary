AWS starts with ‘A’ because it’s the ideal cloud provider or platform to begin your cloud learning journey or migration to the cloud. 
In fact, when it comes to anything cloud-related, start with ‘A’ — start with Amazon Web Services. 
I may sound like I’m advertising them, but fear not, it’s just an ethical, heart felt endorsement.



The Origins of AWS
Every super hero has an origin story, and AWS is no different. Amazon Web Services, Inc was officially launched in 2006, by its parent company Amazon (.com).
The first service that was officially launched by AWS is Simple Storage Service (S3), a simple storage service as the name implies, and then came compute power.

Did you know about it’s South African Origins in Cape Town? 
So, Cape Town is considered the birthplace of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (more affectionately known as EC2), the second service offered by AWS.

This origin story traces back to the founding of the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) service in 2004, which is now regarded as one of the fundamental pieces of cloud computing technology. 
A passionate team of AWS developers and engineers in Cape Town, South Africa, created a single virtual server instance allowing South African customers to access practically unlimited cloud computing capacity without needing an on-premises data center. 
It was a watershed moment for AWS, and it changed the trajectory of cloud computing worldwide.

…And then came databases, and then this, and then that…

AWS initially launched with only Elastic Compute Cloud and Simple Storage (EC2 and S3, the bedrock of AWS), but have since expanded to a highly available global infrastructure comprising hundreds of services…


The Global Infrastructure of AWS
The cloud pioneer, AWS, currently dominates the global cloud landscape with the most regions, availability zones and edge locations, providing high availability and disaster recovery for their consumers and clients.

Regions
This vast global network is divided into physical, independent regions, each containing multiple availability zones (AZs).

Availability Zones
These AZs are essentially clusters of data centers that are interconnected and redundant, providing reliable and fault-tolerant infrastructure.

Edge Locations
Additionally, AWS has edge locations scattered across the globe, which serve as strategic caching points for content, reducing latency and accelerating delivery for applications that require ultra-fast performance.

This tiered infrastructure enables AWS to offer a robust and responsive platform for applications and workloads of all kinds.


Top Companies That Use AWS
Here are some popular companies that leverage the global infrastructure of AWS and deliver seamless content and services to their customers.

Netflix
Netflix relies on AWS to power its streaming service, handling over 250 million hours of video content daily. AWS enables Netflix to scale rapidly, ensuring seamless streaming and personalized recommendations for its global audience.

Pinterest
Pinterest utilizes AWS to manage its vast image and video repository, leveraging machine learning and analytics to enhance user experience. AWS helps Pinterest handle massive traffic spikes and provides real-time insights to improve content discovery and engagement.

Uber
Uber depends on AWS to fuel its ride-sharing platform, processing millions of requests and coordinating rides in real-time. AWS enables Uber to scale its infrastructure dynamically, ensuring reliable and efficient services for its drivers and passengers worldwide.

Airbnb
Airbnb leverages AWS to power its global accommodation marketplace, handling millions of listings and bookings. AWS enables Airbnb to provide personalized search results, scalable infrastructure, and secure payment processing, ensuring a seamless experience for hosts and guests alike.

Spotify
Spotify uses AWS to power its music streaming service, delivering millions of songs and podcasts to users worldwide. AWS enables Spotify to handle massive traffic, provide personalized recommendations, and scale its infrastructure dynamically, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable listening experience.


Additional Advantages of Starting with AWS

Community Support
AWS boasts the largest and most active community, both online and offline, ensuring you’ll have a comprehensive support network throughout your cloud journey.

Comprehensive Learning Resources
AWS offers a diverse range of learning materials, catering to various learning styles, including bite-sized videos, step-by-step tutorials, workshops, detailed documentation, gamified learning, and informative blogs. This wealth of resources guarantees you’ll find a learning approach that suits your needs.

Diverse Career Opportunities
The AWS cloud ecosystem presents a wide range of career paths, from cloud development and engineering to independent contracting, freelancing, tutoring, technical writing, and more.
The possibilities are endless, and your career aspirations are within reach.

Why Do Some Services Start With AWS and Others With Amazon?
Once you get started with AWS, you might notice the naming system, and ask, “Why do some services start with AWS and others with Amazon.”
Answer: …because they can, next.

There are several theories around it and for every one of those theories you can find an exception.
The one aspect that stands out the most is that most services with an Amazon prefix can function independently, without requiring other services to operate (consider Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Amazon SQS, Amazon Quicksight, etc.).
From a user’s perspective, these services can be used as standalone solutions. On the other hand, AWS-prefixed services often rely on additional services to function at all, serving as “building blocks” that AWS frequently mentions.
For instance, AWS AppSync is a GraphQL API, but it requires integration with backend services or AWS Step Functions, which act as a control plane for other services. There are exceptions, such as AWS Lambda, which can now be used standalone (thanks to function URLs introduced in 2022), while others argue that Amazon API Gateway is largely useless without accompanying backend services. — Markus Ostertag (AWS Community Hero)

I know it’ll be tempting to try to identify a pattern to simplify your learning, but don’t spend too much time attempting to decipher a pattern, okay? Instead, focus on understanding the function and purpose of each service. It’s like wondering why the sky is called the sky and the sea is called the sea, rather than simply appreciating and enjoying your day at the beach with your delicious ice cream.

At this point AWS needs to release an official statement so that we stop getting lost in the sauce of speculation.


Putting it All Together with An Analogy
International Property Developer

Imagine AWS as an International Property Developer in a futuristic Earth, where the cloud is land…
Like a Property Developer…: AWS

Acquires land in multiple locations worldwide: AWS has data centers and infrastructure in over 25 regions globally.

Builds properties: AWS builds cloud services like EC2, S3, etc., in each location.

Manages and maintains the properties: AWS manages and maintains the cloud infrastructure) across the globe.

Rents out properties to tenants: AWS provides cloud services to customers) in different regions

Connects properties with high-speed transportation routes: (AWS’s global network and edge locations enable fast data transfer)

Allows tenants to easily expand or move their operations between properties: AWS’s global infrastructure enables easy scalability and migration

Continuously develops and expands the property portfolio: AWS innovates and adds new services.

Offers flexible lease terms: Consumption-based model: pay-only-for-what-you-use, pay-as-you-go.

Provides move-in ready spaces, all you have to do is show up: Ease of entry: easy to sign up and start using services.
Fosters a community: AWS community: support forums, meetups, and shared knowledge.

Concluding Remarks
I hope you do the hands-on tutorials, because active learning is essential in cloud computing.
